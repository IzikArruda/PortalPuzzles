# PortalPuzzles
These are the project files of a Unity game I have created. It features procedurally generated terrain and portals that make the rooms seem non-euclidean. The scripts and shader used to create the portals was based off of https://github.com/BLINDED-AM-ME/UnityAssets.

A link to download and play the game instead of the project files is at https://izik.itch.io/rooms.
